# DSDS-EEE-Lab
### DSDS (Digital system design and synthesis) Lab and class programs of 2021 - 25 batch.
- The codes will be a mix of behavioral and data flow modelling (almost none of these are made in structural modelling) 
- You can use most of these for FPGA boards programming (We used <a href = "https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/spartan-7.html">Spartan - 7</a> family along with xc7s50csga324-1 for our lab/classwork program synthesis)
